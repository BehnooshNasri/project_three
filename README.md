# Project Three: Canadian and Certain Jurisdictions Civil Court Cases by Level of Court and Type of Case from 2005 to 2022

## Introduction

This project aims to visualize the civil court cases that have been initiated in Canada and certain jurisdictions. The purpose of the project is to compare the provincial and federal civil court cases through the years and compare jurisdictions. 

The questions this projects is attempting to answer and visualize are: 

1. Is there a certain jurisdiction that has more civil court cases? 
2. What type of civil court cases (family or general civil) are more frequent in all jurisdictions? 
3. Has there been a significant growth pattern acorss different jurisdictions in the number of cases? 

## Methodology

The project is going to be focusing more on the visualization aspect of data analysis, using different JavaScript libraries such as D3, Plotly and perhaps Leaflet. The ETL portion of the data is to use Jupyter Notebook to clean the CSV and using PgAdmin to load the data into a SQL schema. Then using the Flask I will be creating the app to run the HTML, CSS and the JS codes. 

## Data and Resources

The data was retrieved from government of Canada's open database.
